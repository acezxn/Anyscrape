# Anyscrape

Scrape any public data with ease

## Purpose

The first step to write a typical web scraper is to identify which element to scrape. As a result, an immense amount of work is done to research the structure of the web. Even worse, some websites have dynamically changing information on html elements. The application is designed to automatically get information of the html element pointed by the cursor and use it to scrape data.
