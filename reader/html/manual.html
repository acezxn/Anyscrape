    <h1>Welcome to Anyscrape Reader manual</h1>
    <p>
        The first step to write a typical web scraper is to identify which element to scrape. As a result, an immense
        amount of work is done to research the structure of the web. Even worse, some websites have dynamically changing
        information on html elements. The application is designed to automatically get information of the html element
        pointed by the cursor and export it to a json file for the Anyscrape library.
    </p>
    <h2>Quick guide:</h2>
    <h3>Website navigation</h3>
    <p>
        Websites can be searched with the search bar at the top. After
        the search button is clicked, a web viewer would open up to show the website.
        If the web viewer is closed, press search again to reopen.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML element selection</h3>
    <p>
        Hover the mouse on the html element, and hit F12. The Anyscrape Reader would 
        automatically generate the filters for the element.
    </p>
    <h3>Filters</h3>
    <p>
        The types of filters include tag name, tag id, tag class, tag type, and location. 
        By selecting "enable" beside the input boxes, this configures Anyscrape to filter
        html elements based on the enabled filters.
    </p>
    <h4>Location</h4>
    <p>
        The format of the location string follows 0.0.0.0.0 ...<br />
        The leftmost number is the index of the root element, and
        the second leftmost number is the index of the root's child element.
        This pattern applies to every numbers in the location string.
        <br />
        Note: you can change the numbers to simple linear equations
        (in the form of Mx+B, only + and - are supported). the x variable
        will be incremented from zero one by one
        and check the html elements.
        <br />
        For example, you can have 0.x.1.2x+1.1 as the location string.
